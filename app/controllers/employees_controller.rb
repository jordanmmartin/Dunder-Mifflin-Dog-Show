# - For our index page for Employees, a user should be able to click on a specific
# Employee and take them to their corresponding show page.
# - The Employee show page should list all of their attributes (and as a bonus, try
#   to get their picture to show up!)

# As a user, I should be able to create AND edit an Employee, and only be able to
# select 1 dog from a list of already existing dogs.
